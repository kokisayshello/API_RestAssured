Java with Rest Assured
REST Assured is a Java library that provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing powerful, maintainable tests for RESTful APIs.
You can use RestAssured to send HTTP(S) requests, set up expectations/assertions for responses, and perform various API testing tasks.
To run the Java code with RestAssured, you'll need to set up a Java development environment and include RestAssured as a dependency in your project.

Some prerequisites and steps to get started:

1. Java Development Environment: Make sure you have Java installed on your computer. You can download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK) from the official Oracle website;
2. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): You can use an IDE for Java development like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA. An IDE can significantly simplify the development process;
3. Maven or Gradle (Optional): You can use Maven or Gradle as a build tool to manage project dependencies and build your project. While it's not strictly required, it is a good practice for managing dependencie;
